            members in certain types of legal or law enforcement proceedings and may disclose
            such information if we have a good faith belief that doing so is required by law.
            This may include respecting requests from jurisdictions outside of the Philippines.
          %li
            %span.policies-subtitle Preventing Fraud and Other Illegal Activity.
            We may also share personal information about our members when we have a good faith
            belief it is necessary to prevent fraud or other illegal activity, to prevent
            imminent bodily harm, or to protect both ourselves and you from people violating
            our
            = succeed "." do

            members with feed partners (such as other volunteer opportunity listing websites),
            in order to further promote your organization or listings. Please remember that,
            although we endeavour to select only reputable companies who share our commitment to
            customer privacy, we are in no way responsible for the actions or policies of these
            other organizations.

            of this Site.
  %p

  %h2 3. Your control over your information
  %p
    You may control the visibility of most of the information you share with others on the
    Site and change or remove your profile information at any time through your account settings.
    You should review the default settings to make sure they reflect your preferences.
  %p
    You have one of four options for adjusting the privacy settings of your personal profile
    in your preferences, explained below:
    %ul
      %li
        %span.policies-subtitle>
          "Anyone can see my full profile whether they're an
          iVolunteer member or not."
          Your Profile Information will be visible to anyone on
          dthe Internet, regardless of whether they are members of the Site.
      %li
        %span.policies-subtitle>
          "Any iVolunteer.com.ph member can see my full profile."
          This is the DEFAULT setting. All Site members can view your Profile Information.
      %li
        %span.policies-subtitle>
          "Only the people I'm connected to can see my full
          profile. Others can only see my name, city, and photo."
          This is a limited setting
          where only your connections on the Site can see all of your Profile Information while
          other members of the Site can only see your basic information.
      %li
        %span.policies-subtitle>
          "No one can see any part of my profile. This means
          that no one can connect with me."
          Your Profile Information will be hidden from
          public view.
      %li
        Here are some additional things to remember:
        %ul
          %li
            We take certain steps to ensure that other Site members, third party suppliers,
            and service providers use your shared information in a manner consistent with your
            preferences, but we cannot guarantee that they will follow our rules.
          %li
            Some of the content you share and the actions you take will show up on your
            connections' profile pages and other pages that they visit.
          %li
            Information you make available to others might be re-shared or copied by those
            individuals and organizations.
          %li
            When you post information on another member's profile or comment on another
            member's post, that information will be subject to the other member's preferences.
          %li
            We provide you with discussion features for your use. In the event you voluntarily
            disclose personal information using this service, that information, along with any
            content in your communication or post, can be collected, correlated, and used by others.
            This may result in unsolicited messages from or improper and unauthorized use of
            your personal information by third parties. Such activities are beyond our control.
          %li
            Even after you remove information from your profile or delete your account,
            copies of that information may remain viewable elsewhere to the extent it has
            been shared with others, it was otherwise distributed pursuant to your preferences,
            or it was copied or stored by others.
          %li
            Certain types of communications that you send to other members cannot be
            removed, such as messages.
          %li
            Information with the lowest privacy setting may be accessed by everyone
            on the Internet (including people not logged into the Site) and is subject
            to indexing by third-party search engines. This information may therefore be
            associated with you outside of our Site (such as on other Internet sites or
            search engines).
          %li
            There are NO privacy settings for certain types of information that you
            post on the Site, such as listings and organization pages. This information is
            public for all members of the Internet, regardless of membership on the Site.
  %h2 4. Thir Party Links
  %p
    We provide links on the Site to other sites of interest. We do not endorse the
    content of these sites or guarantee that they will abide by this Privacy Policy.
    Your use of such linked sites is subject to the terms and conditions and privacy
    policies of the providers of those sites. We encourage our members to be aware
    when they leave our Site and to read the privacy policies of each site that collects
    personal information.
  %h2 5. How we protect information
  %p
    We do our best to keep your information secure, but you must actively participate
    in the process of keeping your information safe.
  %p
    We keep your account information on a secured server behind a firewall. When you
    enter sensitive information (like your password), the information is encrypted using
    secure socket layer technology (SSL). We also reserve the right to analyze accounts
    for fraudulent or irregular behaviour and we may limit use of site features in
    response to possible signs of abuse.
  %p
    Although you can change your privacy options to limit outside access to your
    account, please be aware that none of these security measures are impermeable. We
    cannot control the actions of other Site members and third party organizations. You
    can reduce the inherent risks associated with social networking by exercising common
    sense and discretion: for example, you should choose a strong password, use different
    passwords for different websites and services, and use updated antivirus software.
    You should report any security violations to us as outlined in the section below.
  %h2 6. Questions and concerns
  %p
    Should you have any questions or concerns about the terms and practices of this
    Privacy Policy, or would like to opt out of receiving communications from us at any time.
    You may contact us by sending an email to
    = succeed "." do
      %a{:href => "mail:contactus@ivolunteer.com.ph", :target => "_blank"} contactus@ivolunteer.com.ph
  %h2 7. Changes to this policy
  %p
    We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we do make a change, we
    will announce and post the revised Privacy Policy on this Site. We encourage you to
    review this Privacy Policy periodically. If you continue to use this Site after the
    announcement of the revised Privacy Policy, you will be deemed to have agreed to the
    changed terms and practices. Questions, comments, or complaints about our Privacy
    Policy should be submitted to us by email.
