### Contributing

#### 1. Clone the repo using the steps above

#### 2. Create a feature branch

    $ cd bayaninhand
    $ git checkout -b new_feature

Be descriptive in the feature name and use underscores. Also, don't make it too long as it will make it harder for you to push in the long run.

#### 3. Create tests, do your changes, pass tests, commit.

Please use atomic commits and make the commit messages short but descriptive. "Fixed bug" is not a very descriptive commit message but "Fixed 'insert bug description here' bug" is okay (You don't have to tell how you fixed it, just what the bug was).

#### 4. Push your changes to your feature branch.

    $ git push origin new_feature

#### 5. Create a pull request

Go to https://github.com/crigor/bayaninhand/ and click "Pull request" in the upper right. Add some comments and press "Send pull request".
