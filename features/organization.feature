  So I can create events

  Scenario: Create an organization
    Given a user exists with an email of "me@crigor.com"
    And "me@crigor.com" is logged in
    When I go to the new organization page
    And I fill in the following:
      | Name   | DSWD  |
    And I press "Submit"
    Then I should be on the organization admin page of "DSWD"
